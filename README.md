### Howdy 👋

I am a @NASA researcher studying the simulation and optimization of systems resilience in the design process.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [fmdtools](https://github.com/nasa/fmdtools), which is a python library for modelling (and designing, analyzing, optimizing...) system resilience.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other researchers and industry with interests in the risk/resilience area.
- 🏫 I got my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, where I studied resilience-informed design (and came up with the initial versions of fmdtools).
- 💬 Ask me about multiagent optimization (it was a part of my masters' thesis after all)!
